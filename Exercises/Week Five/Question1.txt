Questions:
(A) Briefly describe the Strategy Design Pattern
(B) When is it appropriate to use the Strategy Design Pattern

Answers:

(A) The Strategy Design Pattern allows the behaviour of the program to be selected at runtime.
It consists of a package of interchangeable classes (all using the same interface),
together with a handling class from where the selection will be made at runtime.

(B) It is appropriate to use the Strategy Pattern in instances where there are more than 1 user
of a program, perhaps on different devices, where one implementation will not work and therefore
another must be created, which will not work on any other type of device - eg an Apple mobile phone vs
an Android one - a program could have elements that need different code for each device to achieve the
same thing - and a sensor piece of code could notify the Strategy pattern piece of code what type of
device is accessing it, and at runtime the strategy pattern code could then select the correct
implementation.
