Question:
“In general, the details of object construction, such as instantiating and
initialising the components that comprise the object, are kept within the
object, often as part of its constructor.”
Comment on this statement with reference to modularity and construction bloat.

Answer:
Where an object becomes extremely complex, with many different constructors or
simply complicated construction with many components, it can become bloated/bulky
(construction bloat) and less modular in nature (because of the complexity).
The Builder pattern can deal with this by moving the constructors into a separate
class.
