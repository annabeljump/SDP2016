Question:
(a) What is the Facade Pattern?
(b) When, and why, would you use the Facade Pattern?

Answer:
(a) The Facade pattern is where an object provides a simple interface to a class
or library in order to make it easier to read and understand. There is usually
a wrapper class which contains the objects that access the library of implementations.

(b) The Facade pattern should be used where the class library is complex, as it can
contain the most commonly used methods. It also reduces external dependencies on different
classes, as most code would use the facade, and therefore making changes to the code
is easier.
