Question:
Sum types and product types are general concepts that allow us to model almost any
kind of data structure. We have seen two methods of writing these types, traits and
generics â€” when should we consider using each?

Answer:
Traits enable unlimited implementations, and provide more structure for the child classes,
but it is difficult to have too much flexibility with data types, unless writing an entirely
new child class.

Generics allow interchangeability between data types specifically, and would be useful if
the type of an object is not known until runtime, and saves writing multiple classes implementing
the same trait/interface but with different data types.
